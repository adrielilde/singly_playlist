# Music Playlist
Dynamic playlist using singly linked lists. 

## Project Description
The project contains a Command Line Interface (CLI) program for the creation of a music playlist. The intent is to allow the user to create a playlist by adding songs. The user will have options such as "play song", "next song", "view playlist" and "Exit". The selection is done by the user via numbered options (1-5). The user inputs will be saved into a ".json" file. Depending on the user selection, the ".json" file will update and add or remove the songs as applicable. The program runs one time, meaning once the user exists the playlist will reset. 

The purpose of this script is to show the use and functionality of singly linked lists.
