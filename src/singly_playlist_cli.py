# Technical Challenge 1: Playlist Management with a Singly
# Linked List.
# Scenario: You‚Äôre tasked with developing the back-end for
# a music app‚Äôs playlist feature. The app should allow
# users to add songs to the end of their playlist and skip to
# the next song.
# Task: Implement a singly linked list to manage the songs in
# a user‚Äôs playlist. The list should support adding songs to the
# end and retrieving the next song to play.
# Operations to be performed on the playlist, such as ‚Äúadd song‚Äù
# and ‚Äúplay next‚Äù.
